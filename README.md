# Linear Regression – Early ML Exploration

This project is an exploratory Jupyter Notebook implementing **Linear Regression** using Python and scikit-learn.

It represents early experimentation with regression modeling, feature handling, and prediction workflows.

---

## Purpose

The goal of this notebook was to:

- Understand the fundamentals of linear regression
- Practice fitting a regression model to data
- Explore how input features relate to predicted outputs
- Gain familiarity with scikit-learn’s regression API

This is a **learning-focused project**, not a production-ready model.

---

## Techniques Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Linear Regression
- Jupyter Notebook for experimentation

---

## Structure

- `linearRegression.ipynb` — notebook containing:
  - Data loading
  - Feature preparation
  - Model training
  - Prediction examples

---

## Notes

- This notebook reflects early-stage learning and experimentation
- Focus is on understanding concepts rather than optimization
- No formal evaluation metrics or validation strategy included
- Code is intentionally exploratory

---

## Possible Future Improvements

If revisited, this project could be extended with:

- Train/test splits
- Model evaluation (R², MAE, MSE)
- Feature scaling
- Visualization of predictions vs actual values
- Refactoring into scripts or pipelines

---

## Disclaimer

This project is included as part of a learning history and should not be considered production-grade machine learning code.
